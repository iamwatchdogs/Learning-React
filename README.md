# Welcome to Learning-React Repo

This is the repo that will act as a sandbox environment for me to get some hands-on learning for React Framework. Feel free to check my progress and suggest me through [GitHub Issues](../../issues). Please note that this repo is solely for **my** learning and no external contribution will be merged into this repo. I would really appreciate your work but I will not be merging any of your pull requests into this repo.

## Props and PropTypes Class Components (Legacy Implementation)

In the topic of Props and PropTypes for Class Components, I had some good hands-on experience on the following topics:

- [x] How Props are implemented in Class Components?
- [x] Differences and Similarities between Props implementation in both Class Components and Functional Components.
- [x] Destructuring Props in Class Components.
  - Within `render()` method.
  - Using `componentDidMount()` method.
- [x] Setting Default Props Values. 
  - Defining `defaultProps` as a static property within the class component.
  - Defining `defaultProps` after the class component has been defined.
- [x] PropTypes are implemented exactly as the functional components.

## Refactoring Notes

- Refactored all the components into the directory: [7f3ea10](../commit/7f3ea10)

  > Moved all the indirectly used component into the `components` directory
